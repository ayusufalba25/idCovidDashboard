![Dashboard Overview](https://github.com/ayusufalba25/idCovidDashboard/blob/master/images/Dashboard%20Overview.png)

I've done some query in Google BigQuery platform to get data for Indonesia Covid-19 cases within Covid-19 open data database. After that, I made a dashboard using Google Big Data Studio to visualize the data.
